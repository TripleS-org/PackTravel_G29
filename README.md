PackTravel is a web-application that connects people who want to carpool, share a cab or ride a bus together. Users can offer rides with their own vehicles, or travel together as a group in a cab or a bus. PackTravel helps you stay on a budget by reducing your travel expenses so that you don't have to miss out on that concert you've been wanting to attend üòâ.

## üíé Features
*   Users can create rides - personal vehicle, cab or taxi
*   Autocomplete for source and destination points
*   Users can send requests to join rides, cancel a ride request
*   Ride owners can accept requests from other riders to join rides, ride owners can delete their own rides
*   Forum for every ride to discuss logistics

## üë• Audience
Any person who is looking to reduce spending on their commute expenditure can use our application.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Deployment and Installation
*   PackTravel is built using MongoDB Atlas database, Django (Python) for backend-services, and HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap for the front-end.
*   The application can be deployed on any web-server running on premise or in the cloud. See [django deployment](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/deployment/) to setup django on a VM.
*   See [developer environment setup](INSTALL.md#--developer-environment-setup) to setup your development server.
*   Common issues faced by users while setting up the developer environment are listed [here](INSTALL.md#debugging).

## Scaling PackTravel
![Scale PackTravel](images/scale-PackTravel.png "Scale PackTravel")
*   It is possible to scale PackTravel horizontally because of how we designed the application.
*   All APIs are stateless (REST); Therefore, any application server in a cluster can handle a request.
*   We can use a CDN such as Amazon S3, Cloudflare to serve static assets (images). This enables quicker load time as CDN servers are spread across geographic regions.
*   The bottleneck in PackTravel is the email sending feature. If we use a message queue such as Kafka to offload the task of sending an email to a different application (Kafka consumer), it will free our application server's resources quickly.
*   MongoDB is designed to handle large amounts of data and high levels of throughput. It can distribute data across multiple servers and process it in parallel. It has built-in support for sharding and this makes it easy to scale MongoDB horizontally by adding more servers as needed to handle the increased load.

## üéØ Enhancements
*   Merge rides - users should be able to join rides in a via point between a source and a destination (feature). 
*   Ride ratings - users should be able to rate other users after a ride is complete (feature).
*   2FA - Add functionality to support 2 factor authentication to login (security)
*   Cab Fare estimation to help make a more informed ride choice.
*   Owners of ride now notified via email when the ride has reached capacity!
